# Unified Context Engineering & IADPVEC Methodology

**A comprehensive framework for AI-assisted development that combines systematic context provision with structured collaboration workflows.**

_Merging the best of Context Engineering's comprehensive preparation with IADPVEC's proven execution methodology._

---

## 🎯 **Core Philosophy**

> **Context is King, Process is Crown**

**The Fundamental Truth**: Most AI failures stem from two sources:
1. **Insufficient Context** - AI lacks comprehensive understanding of what you want
2. **Uncontrolled Execution** - AI acts without proper validation and approval

This methodology solves both by combining:
- **Context Engineering's** comprehensive preparation and documentation
- **IADPVEC's** controlled execution and validation workflow

---

## 🏆 **The Unified Golden Rules**

### **The IADPVEC-CE Methodology**

**I** - **INGEST**: Thoroughly analyze current state using context engineering principles  
**A** - **ASSESS**: Evaluate using comprehensive context and documentation  
**D** - **DISCUSS**: Present findings with full context transparency  
**P** - **PLAN**: Create detailed implementation blueprint (like PRPs)  
**V** - **VALIDATE**: Confirm implementation against success criteria  
**E** - **EXECUTE**: Implement only with explicit permission  
**C** - **COMMIT**: Document as source of truth and breadcrumbs

### **The Sacred Trinity of Success**

1. **Comprehensive Context** (Before any work begins)
2. **Controlled Execution** (Never act without permission)
3. **Continuous Documentation** (Git as source of truth)

## 📋 **Project Setup: The Context Foundation**

### **Essential Context Files**

Every project requires these foundational documents:

```

```

### **CLAUDE.md: Unified AI Behavior Rules**

```markdown
### 🔄 Context Awareness & Project Understanding
- **Always read `PLANNING.md`** first to understand architecture, goals, and constraints
- **Check `TASK.md`** before starting work - add new tasks with date if missing
- **Review relevant examples** in the `examples/` folder for patterns to follow
- **Never assume missing context** - ask questions if uncertain about requirements
- **Follow IADPVEC methodology** - never jump straight to implementation

### 🚦 IADPVEC Execution Protocol
- **INGEST**: Analyze current state and gather all relevant context
- **ASSESS**: Evaluate what's working, broken, or needed using available documentation
- **DISCUSS**: Present findings and proposed solutions clearly
- **PLAN**: Create detailed, step-by-step implementation plan
- **VALIDATE**: Confirm implementation meets requirements before proceeding
- **EXECUTE**: Implement only after explicit developer approval
- **COMMIT**: Document changes in git with comprehensive commit messages

### 🧱 Code Structure & Architecture
- **Never create files longer than 500 lines** - refactor into modules
- **Follow consistent patterns** from `examples/` and `PLANNING.md`
- **Organize by feature/responsibility**:
  - `agent.py` - Main agent definition and logic
  - `tools.py` - Tool functions and integrations
  - `models.py` - Data models and validation
  - `config.py` - Configuration and settings
- **Use relative imports** within packages for cleaner dependencies

### 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance
- **Create comprehensive tests** for all new features using patterns from `examples/testing/`
- **Mirror main structure** in `/tests` folder
- **Include minimum test cases**:
  - Expected use case
  - Edge case handling
  - Failure scenario
- **Update existing tests** when modifying logic
- **Ensure 80%+ test coverage** for critical components

### 📎 Style & Standards
- **Language**: Python as primary language
- **Formatting**: PEP8 compliance, type hints, Black formatting
- **Validation**: Pydantic for data validation
- **APIs**: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy/SQLModel for persistence
- **Documentation**: Google-style docstrings for all functions
- **Environment**: python_dotenv with .env configuration

### 📚 Documentation & Knowledge Preservation
- **Update README.md** when adding features or changing setup
- **Comment complex logic** with `# Reason:` explanations
- **Create comprehensive commit messages** that serve as breadcrumbs
- **Generate PRPs** for complex features using `/generate-prp`
- **Maintain examples** that demonstrate current best practices

### 🔒 Security & Safety Rules
- **Never commit secrets** - use .env files with .gitignore
- **Validate all inputs** using Pydantic models
- **Handle errors gracefully** with proper exception handling
- **Never hallucinate dependencies** - only use verified packages
- **Confirm file paths exist** before referencing in code

### 🎯 Success Criteria
- **All tests pass**: `pytest tests/ -v`
- **Code quality**: `ruff check .` and `mypy .` with no errors
- **Functionality works**: Manual testing confirms requirements met
- **Documentation complete**: README and relevant docs updated
- **Git history clean**: Meaningful commits with clear progression
```

## 🔄 **IADPVEC-CE Workflow in Detail**

### **Phase 1: INGEST (Context Gathering)**

#### **Startup Protocol**
```
Developer: "Let's work on [PROJECT/FEATURE]"
AI: "I'll get up to speed with the project context first."
```

**AI Actions:**
1. **Read foundational context**:
   - `PLANNING.md` - Architecture and constraints
   - `TASK.md` - Current work and priorities
   - `CLAUDE.md` - Behavior rules and standards
   - `README.md` - Project overview and setup

2. **Analyze current state**:
   - Directory structure and organization
   - Existing code patterns and conventions
   - Configuration and environment setup
   - Test coverage and quality metrics

3. **Review relevant examples**:
   - Similar implementations in `examples/`
   - Architecture patterns to follow
   - Testing approaches and standards

**Success Criteria:**
- Complete understanding of project context
- Clear picture of existing patterns and conventions
- Awareness of any constraints or requirements

### **Phase 2: ASSESS (Comprehensive Evaluation)**

#### **Deep Analysis**
**AI Actions:**
1. **Evaluate current state**:
   - What's working well
   - What's broken or missing
   - What needs improvement
   - Dependencies and integrations

2. **Identify patterns and gaps**:
   - Code organization consistency
   - Testing coverage gaps
   - Documentation completeness
   - Architecture alignment

3. **Research requirements**:
   - External API documentation
   - Library best practices
   - Integration patterns
   - Performance considerations

**Output Example:**
```
ASSESS: "Project analysis complete:
✅ Working: Core FastAPI structure, Docker setup, basic testing
⚠️  Issues: Missing Pydantic v2 compliance, incomplete test coverage
📋 Needed: User authentication, async task processing, API rate limiting
🎯 Priority: Fix Pydantic issues first (blocking), then add authentication"
```

### **Phase 3: DISCUSS (Transparent Communication)**

#### **Solution Presentation**
**AI Behavior:**
- Present findings clearly with context
- Propose specific solutions with reasoning
- Reference examples and documentation
- Identify risks and dependencies
- Wait for developer feedback

**Template:**
```
DISCUSS: "Based on my analysis of [CONTEXT], I found [SPECIFIC_ISSUES].

I recommend [SPECIFIC_SOLUTIONS] because:
- [REASONING_1] (following pattern from examples/auth.py)
- [REASONING_2] (per FastAPI best practices documentation)
- [REASONING_3] (addressing constraint in PLANNING.md)

This approach will:
✅ [BENEFIT_1]
✅ [BENEFIT_2]
⚠️ [POTENTIAL_RISK] - mitigation: [SOLUTION]

Shall I proceed with creating a detailed implementation plan?"
```

### **Phase 4: PLAN (Detailed Blueprint)**

#### **Implementation Planning**
**AI Actions:**
1. **Create step-by-step plan**:
   - Specific files to create/modify
   - Exact changes needed
   - Dependencies to install
   - Tests to create/update

2. **Reference context**:
   - Follow patterns from examples
   - Adhere to CLAUDE.md standards
   - Align with PLANNING.md architecture
   - Update TASK.md appropriately

3. **Include validation steps**:
   - Test commands to run
   - Quality checks to perform
   - Success criteria to meet

**Template:**
```
PLAN: "Detailed implementation plan for [FEATURE]:

Phase 1: Foundation
1. Create models.py following examples/models/user_model.py pattern
2. Add Pydantic v2 models for User, Auth, Session
3. Install dependencies: fastapi-users[sqlalchemy], passlib[bcrypt]

Phase 2: Implementation  
4. Create auth/router.py following examples/auth/fastapi_auth.py
5. Implement JWT token handling per PLANNING.md security section
6. Add middleware integration in main.py

Phase 3: Testing
7. Create tests/test_auth.py following examples/testing/auth_tests.py
8. Add integration tests for login/logout flows
9. Update existing tests for authenticated endpoints

Phase 4: Validation
10. Run: pytest tests/ -v --cov=auth
11. Check: ruff check . && mypy .
12. Test: Manual verification of auth flows

Files to modify:
- app/main.py (lines 15-20, 45-50)
- app/core/config.py (add JWT_SECRET setting)
- requirements.txt (add new dependencies)

Success criteria:
✅ All tests pass with >80% coverage
✅ Authentication flow works end-to-end
✅ No linting or type errors
✅ Documentation updated

Ready to proceed? (This will take ~30 minutes to implement fully)"
```

### **Phase 5: VALIDATE (Implementation Confirmation)**

#### **Success Verification**
**AI Actions:**
1. **Confirm implementation quality**:
   - All planned changes completed
   - Tests pass successfully
   - Code quality standards met
   - Functionality works as intended

2. **Validate against requirements**:
   - Original requirements satisfied
   - Success criteria achieved
   - No regressions introduced
   - Performance acceptable

**Template:**
```
VALIDATE: "Implementation verification complete:

✅ Code Quality:
  - All tests pass: 47/47 (100%)
  - Coverage: 89% (exceeds 80% requirement)
  - Linting: 0 errors, 0 warnings
  - Type checking: No issues found

✅ Functionality:
  - User registration works correctly
  - JWT authentication flow operational

  - Error handling covers edge cases

✅ Requirements:
  - Follows FastAPI patterns from examples/
  - Adheres to CLAUDE.md standards
  - Integrates with existing architecture
  - Documentation updated in README.md

Ready for commit and next phase."
```

### **Phase 6: EXECUTE (Controlled Implementation)**

#### **Permission-Based Action**
**AI Behavior:**
- **Wait for explicit permission**: "ok", "proceed", "implement this"
- **Follow exact plan** discussed and approved
- **Make incremental changes** with verification
- **Report progress** and any unexpected issues

**Never execute without permission phrases like:**
- "Let me implement this..."
- "I'll start by..."
- "First, I'll create..."

**Always wait for:**
- "ok, proceed"
- "implement the plan"
- "make those changes"
- "go ahead"

### **Phase 7: COMMIT (Documentation & Preservation)**

#### **Source of Truth Creation**
**AI Actions:**
1. **Create comprehensive commit message**:
   - What was implemented and why
   - Technical details and decisions
   - References to requirements/issues
   - Context for future developers

2. **Update project documentation**:
   - Mark tasks complete in TASK.md
   - Update README if needed
   - Add examples if applicable
   - Create/update PRPs for complex features

**Commit Message Template:**
```

### **PRP Integration with IADPVEC**

**When to Generate PRPs:**
- Complex features requiring multiple components
- Features involving external integrations
- Architecture changes affecting multiple modules
- Features with unclear requirements needing research

**PRP Integration Points:**
- **ASSESS Phase**: Generate PRP if complexity warrants it
- **PLAN Phase**: Use PRP as detailed implementation blueprint
- **VALIDATE Phase**: Use PRP success criteria for verification

---

Resolves: [Reference to TASK.md item]
Files: [Key files modified]
Tests: [Testing summary]
```

### **Examples as Living Documentation**

**Keep Examples Current:**
- Update examples when patterns evolve
- Add new examples for novel solutions
- Retire outdated patterns with migration notes
- Cross-reference between examples and actual implementations

---

## 🎯 **Final Principles**

### **The Unified Mindset**

1. **Context Before Action** - Never implement without comprehensive understanding
2. **Permission Before Execution** - Never code without explicit approval
3. **Validation Before Proceeding** - Always confirm implementation works
4. **Documentation as Breadcrumbs** - Preserve knowledge for future developers
5. **Examples as Teachers** - Show, don't just tell, how things should be done
6. **Process as Safety Net** - IADPVEC prevents more problems than it creates

### **Success Formula**

```
Comprehensive Context + Controlled Process + Continuous Documentation = Reliable AI-Assisted Development
```

**This methodology transforms AI from an unpredictable tool into a reliable development partner that consistently delivers production-ready code while maintaining full developer control and creating valuable knowledge artifacts.**
