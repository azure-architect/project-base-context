# Context Engineering + IADPVEVC: Complete AI Development Methodology

**The unified framework that combines comprehensive context preparation with controlled execution for reliable AI-assisted development.**

> **Context Engineering provides the foundation. IADPVEVC ensures safe execution. Together they transform AI from an unpredictable tool into a reliable development partner.**

---

## 🎯 **Two Complementary Methodologies**

### **Context Engineering: The Foundation**
- **Comprehensive preparation** through documentation, examples, and patterns
- **Structured context** that gives AI complete understanding
- **Knowledge preservation** through examples and architecture decisions

### **IADPVEVC: The Execution Framework**
- **Controlled workflow** that prevents unauthorized changes
- **Validation loops** that ensure quality and correctness
- **Transparent process** that maintains developer control

### **The Integration**
```
Context Engineering (What to build) + IADPVEVC (How to build safely) = Reliable AI Development
```

---

## 🚀 **Quick Start Options**

### **Option 1: Complete Setup (30 minutes)**
Perfect for new projects that want the full benefits immediately.

```bash

```

### **Option 2: Rapid Start (10 minutes)**
Get started quickly and adopt patterns incrementally.

```bash
# 1. Essential files only
cp templates/CLAUDE.md .

## 📝 **Git Workflow Integration**

### **Automated Project Status Tracking**
The framework includes scripts for maintaining project continuity and AI assistant context recovery:

#### **scripts/git-status-update.sh** - Status Only Updates
```bash
# Update project status without committing
scripts/git-status-update.sh "Discussed Docker testing approach, proceeding with validation"
```

#### **scripts/git-commit-update.sh** - Commit + Status Updates  
```bash
# Commit changes and update status
scripts/git-commit-update.sh "Complete Docker infrastructure" "Ready for testing phase"

# Commit with default status
scripts/git-commit-update.sh "Fix port mapping strategy"
```

### **Setup Aliases for Quick Access**
```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc
alias gsu='scripts/git-status-update.sh'      # Status update only
alias gcu='scripts/git-commit-update.sh'      # Commit + status update
```

### **AI Assistant Recovery**
Both scripts create `.git/PROJECT_STATUS.txt` containing:
- **Recent commit history** (last 5 commits)
- **Current project status** with timestamp
- **Branch information** and repository state
- **Recovery context** for interrupted sessions

When an AI assistant needs to get up to speed: **"Read .git/PROJECT_STATUS.txt"** provides complete project context.

### **IADPVEC Integration**
- **After DISCUSS phase:** Status update with agreed approach
- **After EXECUTE phase:** Commit with implementation details
- **Session interruptions:** Status update with current IADPVEC phase
- **Recovery:** AI reads status file to understand where work left off

---

## 🔄 **The IADPVEC-CE Workflow**

### **Phase 1: INGEST (Context Gathering)**
```
Developer: "Let's work on [feature]"
AI: "I'll get up to speed with the project context first."

✅ Read PLANNING.md - architecture and constraints
✅ Check TASK.md - current priorities and work
✅ Review CLAUDE.md - behavior rules and standards
✅ Analyze existing codebase structure
✅ Study relevant examples for patterns
```

### **Phase 2: ASSESS (Comprehensive Evaluation)**
```
AI: "ASSESS: Current state evaluation..."

✅ Evaluate what's working well
✅ Identify issues and gaps
✅ Research requirements and constraints
✅ Determine implementation approach
✅ Assess complexity and risks
```

### **Phase 3: DISCUSS (Transparent Communication)**
```
AI: "DISCUSS: Based on my analysis, I recommend..."

✅ Present findings clearly
✅ Propose specific solutions with reasoning
✅ Reference examples and documentation
✅ Identify risks and mitigation strategies
✅ Wait for developer feedback
```

### **Phase 4: PLAN (Detailed Blueprint)**
```
Developer: "Sounds good, proceed with the plan"
AI: "PLAN: Detailed implementation plan..."

✅ Create step-by-step implementation plan
✅ Specify files to create/modify
✅ Include validation and testing steps
✅ Reference context and examples
✅ Define success criteria
```

### **Phase 5: VALIDATE (Implementation Confirmation)**
```
AI: "VALIDATE: Implementation verification..."

✅ Confirm all planned changes completed
✅ Run tests and quality checks
✅ Verify functionality works as intended
✅ Ensure requirements satisfied
✅ Check for regressions
```

### **Phase 6: EXECUTE (Controlled Implementation)**
```
Developer: "ok implement this" or "proceed"
AI: "EXECUTE: Implementing approved plan..."

✅ Follow exact approved plan
✅ Make incremental changes with verification
✅ Report progress and issues
✅ Only execute with explicit permission
```

### **Phase 7: COMMIT (Documentation & Preservation)**
```
AI: "COMMIT: Creating documentation..."

✅ Create comprehensive commit message
✅ Update TASK.md with completion
✅ Update documentation if needed
✅ Preserve knowledge in git history
✅ Create breadcrumbs for future developers
```
