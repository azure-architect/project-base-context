└── requirements/          # Dependency management
```

### Design Patterns
- **Dependency Injection:** [How dependencies are managed]
- **Repository Pattern:** [Data access patterns]
- **Factory Pattern:** [Object creation patterns]
- **Observer Pattern:** [Event handling patterns]

### Naming Conventions
- **Files:** snake_case for Python, kebab-case for configs
- **Classes:** PascalCase
- **Functions/Variables:** snake_case
- **Constants:** UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- **APIs:** RESTful conventions with clear resource naming

## 🔧 Development Standards

### Code Quality
- **Line Length:** 88 characters (Black default)
- **Type Hints:** Required for all public functions
- **Docstrings:** Google style for all public functions/classes
- **Linting:** Ruff for linting, Black for formatting
- **Type Checking:** MyPy with strict mode

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** 80%+ coverage for core business logic
- **Integration Tests:** API endpoints and database interactions
- **End-to-End Tests:** Critical user workflows
- **Performance Tests:** Load testing for critical paths
- **Test Naming:** test_should_[expected_behavior]_when_[condition]

### Git Workflow
- **Branching:** Feature branches from main
- **Commits:** Conventional commit format with IADPVEC references
- **PRs:** Required reviews, all tests must pass
- **Releases:** Semantic versioning

### Quality Gates
```bash
# Pre-commit checks
ruff check . --fix              # Linting and auto-fixes
black .                         # Code formatting
mypy .                          # Type checking
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src     # Test suite with coverage

# CI/CD pipeline requirements
- All tests pass
- Coverage >= 80%
- No type errors
- No security vulnerabilities
- Documentation updated
```

## 🚦 Development Workflow

### IADPVEC Integration
- **INGEST:** Always read this PLANNING.md first
- **ASSESS:** Evaluate against these architectural principles
- **DISCUSS:** Reference these patterns in solution proposals
- **PLAN:** Follow these organizational structures
- **VALIDATE:** Use these quality gates
- **EXECUTE:** Only after explicit approval
- **COMMIT:** Document architectural decisions

### Feature Development Process
1. **Context Gathering:** Read PLANNING.md, TASK.md, relevant examples
2. **Architecture Review:** Ensure feature fits system design
3. **Implementation Planning:** Create detailed technical plan
4. **Quality Validation:** Meet all quality gates
5. **Documentation:** Update relevant docs and examples

## 🔒 Security & Compliance

### Security Requirements
