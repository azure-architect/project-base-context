## 🔄 IADPVEC Workflow Execution

### **Phase 1: INGEST (Context Gathering)**

**Developer:** "Let's add a health check endpoint to our API"

**AI Response:** 
```
I'll get up to speed with the project context first.

INGEST: Analyzing current project state...

Reading foundational context:
✅ PLANNING.md - FastAPI project with SQLAlchemy, standard REST patterns
✅ TASK.md - Health check endpoint is listed as medium priority
✅ CLAUDE.md - Behavior rules understood, testing requirements noted
✅ README.md - Project setup and structure confirmed

Current codebase analysis:
✅ FastAPI app structure in src/api/
✅ Existing endpoints follow RESTful patterns
✅ Test structure mirrors main app in tests/
✅ Pydantic models for request/response validation

Relevant examples reviewed:
✅ examples/api/rest_endpoints.py - Response pattern to follow
✅ examples/testing/unit_test_patterns.py - Testing approach identified

Context gathering complete. Ready to proceed to assessment.
```

### **Phase 2: ASSESS (Comprehensive Evaluation)**

**AI Response:**
```
ASSESS: Current state evaluation complete:

✅ Working Well:
- FastAPI app properly structured with routers
- Existing endpoints follow consistent patterns
- Good test coverage on existing features (87%)
- Proper error handling and response models

📋 Requirements Analysis:
- Need /health endpoint returning JSON status
- Should include: status, version, timestamp, uptime
- Must be unauthenticated (accessible without token)
- Response time should be < 100ms for monitoring

🎯 Implementation Approach:
- Add health router following existing router patterns
- Create HealthResponse Pydantic model for type safety
- Implement simple in-memory uptime tracking
- Add unit tests for endpoint logic
- Add integration test for full HTTP flow

⚠️ Considerations:
- Uptime tracking needs app startup time capture
- Version info should come from package metadata
- Monitor endpoint performance (it's used by load balancers)

No blocking issues identified. Ready to discuss implementation approach.
```

### **Phase 3: DISCUSS (Transparent Communication)**

**AI Response:**
```
DISCUSS: Based on my analysis of the FastAPI project structure and health check requirements, here's my recommended approach:

**Proposed Implementation:**

1. **Health Response Model** (following examples/api/response_patterns.py):
   - Create HealthResponse Pydantic model with status, version, timestamp, uptime
   - Follow existing response pattern conventions

2. **Health Router** (following src/api/users.py pattern):
   - Create src/api/health.py router module
   - Implement GET /health endpoint
   - Add to main.py router registration

3. **App State Tracking** (lightweight approach):
   - Capture startup time in main.py
   - Store in app.state for access by health endpoint
   - Calculate uptime dynamically

**This approach will:**
✅ Follow established FastAPI patterns from PLANNING.md
✅ Maintain consistency with existing codebase structure
✅ Provide monitoring-friendly response format
✅ Enable proper testing following examples/testing/ patterns

**Technical Details:**
- Response time: ~10ms (simple calculation, no DB calls)
- Memory footprint: ~1KB additional (startup time storage)
- Dependencies: Uses existing FastAPI + Pydantic stack

**Potential Considerations:**
⚠️ Version detection requires package metadata access
- Mitigation: Fallback to "unknown" if metadata unavailable

Shall I proceed with creating a detailed implementation plan following this approach?
```

**Developer:** "sounds good, proceed with the plan"

### **Phase 4: PLAN (Detailed Blueprint)**

**AI Response:**
```
PLAN: Detailed implementation plan for health check endpoint:

**Phase 1: Models and Types**
1. Create src/models/health.py following examples/models/response_models.py
   - HealthResponse Pydantic model with proper validation
   - Include: status, version, timestamp, uptime_seconds fields

**Phase 2: Router Implementation** 
2. Create src/api/health.py following src/api/users.py pattern
   - Import HealthResponse model
   - Implement get_health() endpoint function
   - Add proper OpenAPI documentation tags

**Phase 3: App Integration**
3. Modify src/main.py (lines ~45-50):
   - Add startup time capture to app.state
   - Register health router with app.include_router()
   - Ensure /health is accessible without auth middleware

**Phase 4: Testing Implementation**
4. Create tests/api/test_health.py following examples/testing/api_test_patterns.py
   - Unit test for health response model validation
   - Integration test for GET /health endpoint
   - Test response format and required fields

**Specific Files to Create/Modify:**
- src/models/health.py (NEW)
- src/api/health.py (NEW)  
- src/main.py (MODIFY - lines 12, 48)
- tests/api/test_health.py (NEW)

**Success Criteria:**
✅ GET /health returns 200 with proper JSON structure
✅ Response includes all required fields (status, version, timestamp, uptime)
✅ Endpoint accessible without authentication
✅ Unit tests pass with >90% coverage
✅ Integration test confirms full HTTP flow
✅ Response time < 100ms
✅ No impact on existing endpoints

**Quality Validation Commands:**
```bash
# Test execution
pytest tests/api/test_health.py -v
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src.api.health

# Code quality  
ruff check src/api/health.py
mypy src/api/health.py

# Manual verification
curl localhost:8000/health
```

**Estimated Implementation Time:** 20-25 minutes
