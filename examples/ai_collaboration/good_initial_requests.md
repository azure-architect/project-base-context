# Effective INITIAL.md Examples

*Real-world examples of effective feature requests that produce excellent results with Context Engineering + IADPVEC methodology.*

---

## üéØ **The Anatomy of Effective Requests**

### **Essential Components**
1. **FEATURE:** Clear, specific description with functional requirements
2. **EXAMPLES:** References to patterns and examples to follow
3. **DOCUMENTATION:** Links to relevant technical documentation
4. **OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:** Context, constraints, and gotchas

### **Success Formula**
```
Specific Requirements + Clear Examples + Good Documentation + Important Context = Excellent Implementation
```

---

## ‚úÖ **Example 1: Simple API Endpoint (Excellent)**

```markdown
## FEATURE:
Add a user profile endpoint that allows authenticated users to retrieve and update their own profile information including name, email, avatar URL, and bio. Should support partial updates (PATCH) and full replacement (PUT).

## EXAMPLES:
- examples/api/user_endpoints.py - Follow this pattern for user-related endpoints
- examples/models/user_models.py - Use existing User model and extend if needed
- examples/testing/api_test_patterns.py - Testing approach for authenticated endpoints

## DOCUMENTATION:
- FastAPI PATCH/PUT handling: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/body-updates/
- Pydantic partial model updates: https://docs.pydantic.dev/usage/models/#partial-models
- Authentication patterns from PLANNING.md security section

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
- Must validate user can only access their own profile (no privilege escalation)
- Email changes should trigger email verification workflow
- Avatar URL should be validated as proper URL format
- Bio field has 500 character limit
- Should return 404 if user profile doesn't exist (edge case)
- Include rate limiting for profile updates (max 10 updates per hour)
```

**Why This Works:**
- ‚úÖ Specific functional requirements with clear scope
- ‚úÖ References concrete examples to follow
- ‚úÖ Links to relevant technical documentation
- ‚úÖ Includes important security and validation considerations
- ‚úÖ Mentions edge cases and business rules

---

## ‚úÖ **Example 2: Complex Integration (Excellent)**

```markdown
## FEATURE:
Implement email notification system that sends transactional emails for user registration, password reset, and profile updates. Should support multiple email providers (SendGrid, Mailgun) with fallback mechanism and proper error handling.

## EXAMPLES:
- examples/integrations/email_service.py - Multi-provider service pattern
- examples/config/settings_management.py - Environment-based configuration
- examples/testing/integration_test_patterns.py - Testing external services
- examples/models/notification_models.py - Event and template modeling

## DOCUMENTATION:
- SendGrid API v3: https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/mail-send/mail-send
- Mailgun API: https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/api-sending.html
- Celery for async processing: https://docs.celeryq.dev/
- Email template best practices from PLANNING.md

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
- Must be async to avoid blocking web requests
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for failed sends
- Store email audit log for compliance (GDPR considerations)
- Templates should support multiple languages (i18n ready)
- Rate limiting per user email address (prevent spam)
- Graceful degradation if all providers are down
- Webhook handling for delivery status updates
- Environment-specific configuration (dev uses console output)
```

**Why This Works:**
- ‚úÖ Complex feature broken down into clear components
- ‚úÖ Multiple examples covering different aspects
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation for all integrations
- ‚úÖ Addresses reliability, compliance, and operational concerns
- ‚úÖ Considers multiple environments and failure scenarios

---

## ‚úÖ **Example 3: Data Processing Pipeline (Excellent)**

```markdown
## FEATURE:
Build data ingestion pipeline that processes CSV files uploaded to S3, validates data against schema, transforms records, and loads into PostgreSQL with duplicate detection and error reporting.

## EXAMPLES:
- examples/pipelines/etl_pipeline.py - ETL processing pattern
- examples/validation/schema_validation.py - Data validation approach
- examples/storage/s3_integration.py - S3 file handling patterns
- examples/database/bulk_operations.py - Efficient database loading
- examples/monitoring/pipeline_monitoring.py - Progress tracking and alerting

## DOCUMENTATION:
- Pandas for data processing: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/
- SQLAlchemy bulk operations: https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/persistence_techniques.html
- Boto3 S3 operations: https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/s3.html
- Pydantic validation: https://docs.pydantic.dev/usage/validators/
- Pipeline architecture patterns from PLANNING.md

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
- Detect and skip duplicate records based on composite business keys
- Comprehensive error reporting with line-by-line validation results
- Memory-efficient processing for large datasets
- Progress tracking with ETA calculations
- Dead letter queue for failed records
- Schema evolution support (backward compatibility)
- Monitoring integration for pipeline health
- Configurable batch sizes for optimal performance
```

**Why This Works:**
- ‚úÖ Addresses complex data processing requirements systematically
- ‚úÖ References multiple relevant patterns and examples
- ‚úÖ Includes performance and reliability considerations
- ‚úÖ Covers monitoring, error handling, and operational aspects
- ‚úÖ Considers scalability and memory management

## ‚ùå **Counter-Example 1: Vague Request (Poor)**

```markdown
## FEATURE:
Add some user stuff to the API.

## EXAMPLES:
Look at the existing code.

## DOCUMENTATION:
Google it.

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
Make it good.
```

**Why This Fails:**
- ‚ùå Vague requirements ("user stuff")
- ‚ùå No specific examples or patterns to follow
- ‚ùå No actual documentation references
- ‚ùå No meaningful context or constraints
- ‚ùå AI will have to make too many assumptions

---

## ‚ùå **Counter-Example 2: Over-Specified (Poor)**

```markdown
## FEATURE:
Create a UserProfileController class that extends BaseController with methods getUserProfile() on line 45, updateUserProfile() on line 67, and deleteUserProfile() on line 89. Use exactly 3 spaces for indentation and put the opening brace on the same line. The getUserProfile method should call userService.findById(userId) and return a JSON response with status code 200.

## EXAMPLES:
Don't look at examples, just follow these exact specifications.

## DOCUMENTATION:
I don't need documentation, I've specified everything.

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
Just do exactly what I said above, nothing more, nothing less.
```

**Why This Fails:**
- ‚ùå Micro-manages implementation details
- ‚ùå Ignores established patterns and conventions
- ‚ùå Doesn't leverage existing examples or architecture
- ‚ùå Prevents AI from using its knowledge effectively
- ‚ùå Likely to conflict with project standards
