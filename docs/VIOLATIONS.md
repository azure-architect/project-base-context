# IADPVEC Methodology Violations Log

**Purpose:** Document violations of the IADPVEC methodology to learn from mistakes and improve process adherence.

## üìù **Violation #1: Unauthorized Documentation Creation**

**Date:** July 4, 2025  
**Session:** Infrastructure validation and testing  
**IADPVEC Phase:** Should have been DISCUSS, jumped to EXECUTE  

### **What Happened:**
User requested: "create a commit statement, a status statement, and update the planning doc with the test procedure and results."

AI response violated IADPVEC by:
- ‚ùå **Skipped DISCUSS phase** - Did not present implementation plan for approval
- ‚ùå **Skipped explicit permission** - Did not wait for "proceed" or "ok implement this"
- ‚ùå **Made implementation assumptions** - Assumed specific file locations and formats
- ‚ùå **Executed without authorization** - Created multiple files without approval

### **Correct IADPVEC Process Should Have Been:**

**DISCUSS Phase:**
```
"I recommend creating three documentation updates:
1. A comprehensive commit message in .git/COMMIT_MESSAGE capturing infrastructure validation
2. Project status update in .git/PROJECT_STATUS.txt reflecting test results  
3. PLANNING.md updates with test procedures and results

This approach would provide complete documentation of our infrastructure validation work.
Would you like me to proceed with this documentation approach?"
```

**Wait for explicit approval** before moving to PLAN phase.

### **Why This Matters:**
- IADPVEC exists to prevent unauthorized changes
- User should control what gets implemented and how
- Assumptions about implementation details can be wrong
- Process violations undermine methodology reliability

### **Lesson Learned:**
**Always present implementation approach in DISCUSS phase before executing anything.** Even seemingly straightforward requests like "create documentation" require explicit approval of the specific approach.

### **User Feedback:**
"you cowboy'd down the trail with your own new procedure without asking. this whole thing is not part of our documented process"

**Impact:** User correctly identified that the AI created its own unauthorized procedure rather than following established IADPVEC methodology.

## üìã **Violation Prevention Guidelines**

### **Key Reminders:**
1. **Never skip DISCUSS** - Always present implementation plan first
2. **Wait for explicit permission** - Look for "proceed", "ok implement this", or similar
3. **Don't assume implementation details** - Let user approve specific approach
4. **IADPVEC is mandatory** - No exceptions for "simple" or "obvious" requests

### **Red Flags to Watch For:**
- Acting immediately on user requests without discussion
- Creating files or making changes before getting approval
- Assuming user wants a specific implementation approach
- Jumping from user request directly to EXECUTE phase

### **Correct Response Pattern:**
```
User Request ‚Üí ASSESS ‚Üí DISCUSS (present options) ‚Üí WAIT for approval ‚Üí PLAN ‚Üí EXECUTE
```
