Add enhanced IADPVEC workflow procedures and directory structure

- Created project_status/ and commit_statements/ directories for timestamped file systems
- Added sync_workflows.sh script for transferring procedures from active projects
- Transferred iadpvec_task_proposal.md workflow for structured task analysis and discussion
- Transferred iadpvec_task_validation.md workflow for comprehensive implementation verification
- Transferred project_status_update.md workflow for session state capture
- Transferred git_commit_with_prepared_message.md workflow for integrated commit procedures

Technical details:
- Directory structure supports timestamped status and commit archival systems
- Workflow procedures proven effective through microservices-01 FastAPI implementation
- Framework template now includes complete IADPVEC methodology enhancement
- All procedures integrate seamlessly with existing project-base-context structure

Follows patterns from:
- microservices-01 successful workflow implementation and testing
- Established project-base-context template structure and organization

Resolves: Framework synchronization task - enhanced IADPVEC procedures available for all projects
Files: workflows/, project_status/, commit_statements/, docs/, sync_workflows.sh
Tests: Workflow procedures validated through successful FastAPI foundation implementation
