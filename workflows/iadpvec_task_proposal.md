# IADPVEC Workflow: Task Proposal and Discussion

**Structured workflow for creating comprehensive task proposals that enable informed decision-making before implementation.**

---

## üéØ **Purpose**

This workflow creates detailed task proposals that provide complete context and analysis before any implementation begins. It ensures developers have full understanding of:
- What will be built and why
- How it fits into existing architecture
- What the implementation approach will be
- What the expected outcomes are

**Key Principle**: No implementation happens without explicit approval of the complete proposal.

---

## üìã **When to Use This Workflow**

### **Perfect For:**
- **New feature requests** - "Add authentication system"
- **Infrastructure tasks** - "Set up monitoring"
- **Bug fix requests** - "Fix memory leak in worker"
- **Architecture changes** - "Migrate to microservices"
- **Integration tasks** - "Add payment processing"

### **Use When:**
- Developer requests a specific task or feature
- Task complexity is unclear and needs analysis
- Implementation approach needs discussion
- Multiple solutions exist and choice needs validation
- Stakeholder alignment needed before work begins

---

## üîÑ **The Complete Workflow Process**

### **Phase 1: PROPOSED TASK (Task Definition)**

**Format:**
```markdown
## **PROPOSED TASK**

**[Task Title]** - [Brief description with clear objective and scope]

## üöÄ **Best Practices**

### **For AI Assistants**
- **Be thorough** in context gathering - read all relevant documentation
- **Be specific** in proposals - concrete technical solutions, not vague concepts
- **Be honest** about complexity and risks - don't oversimplify challenging work
- **Be explicit** about seeking approval - never assume permission to proceed

### **For Developers**
- **Review proposals carefully** - This is your chance to guide the approach
- **Ask clarifying questions** - Better to discuss upfront than rework later
- **Consider alternatives** - AI proposals are starting points, not final answers
- **Give clear approval** - Explicit "proceed" signals keep workflow moving

### **For Teams**
- **Use for complex tasks** - Simple tasks may not need full proposal workflow
- **Share proposals** - Team members can review and provide input
- **Document decisions** - Capture why certain approaches were chosen
- **Iterate on process** - Improve proposal quality based on outcomes

---

## üìà **Success Metrics**

### **Quality Indicators**
- **Reduced rework** - Less implementation changes after approval
- **Faster development** - Clear direction accelerates implementation
- **Better architecture** - Solutions consider integration and patterns
- **Team alignment** - Everyone understands what's being built

### **Process Efficiency**
- **Quick approvals** - Well-structured proposals get faster decisions
- **Fewer questions** - Complete analysis reduces back-and-forth
- **Clear expectations** - Developers know exactly what they're approving
- **Smooth transitions** - Approved proposals flow seamlessly to implementation

---

**This workflow ensures every task begins with complete understanding and explicit approval, leading to higher quality implementations with fewer surprises and better architectural decisions.**

---

*Use this workflow whenever a task request needs comprehensive analysis and structured discussion before implementation begins.*
