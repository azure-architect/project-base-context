# IADPVEC Workflow: Task Proposal and Discussion

**Structured workflow for creating comprehensive task proposals that enable informed decision-making before implementation.**

---

## 🎯 **Purpose**

This workflow creates detailed task proposals that provide complete context and analysis before any implementation begins. It ensures developers have full understanding of:
- What will be built and why
- How it fits into existing architecture
- What the implementation approach will be
- What the expected outcomes are

**Key Principle**: No implementation happens without explicit approval of the complete proposal.

---

## 📋 **When to Use This Workflow**

### **Perfect For:**
- **New feature requests** - "Add authentication system"
- **Infrastructure tasks** - "Set up monitoring"
- **Bug fix requests** - "Fix memory leak in worker"
- **Architecture changes** - "Migrate to microservices"
- **Integration tasks** - "Add payment processing"

### **Use When:**
- Developer requests a specific task or feature
- Task complexity is unclear and needs analysis
- Implementation approach needs discussion
- Multiple solutions exist and choice needs validation
- Stakeholder alignment needed before work begins

---

## 🔄 **The Complete Workflow Process**

### **Phase 1: PROPOSED TASK (Task Definition)**

**Format:**
```markdown
## **PROPOSED TASK**

**[Task Title]** - [Brief description with clear objective and scope]

## 🔄 **Integration with Full IADPVEC Workflow**

### **This Workflow Covers: INGEST → ASSESS → DISCUSS**
```
PROPOSED TASK → INGEST → ASSESS → DISCUSS → [DEVELOPER APPROVAL]
                                                    ↓
                                           PLAN → VALIDATE → EXECUTE → COMMIT
```

### **Transition to Implementation**
Once developer approves the proposal:
1. **PLAN**: Create detailed implementation plan with specific files and steps
2. **VALIDATE**: Define success criteria and testing approach  
3. **EXECUTE**: Implement according to approved plan
4. **COMMIT**: Document and commit changes with full context

### **Workflow Benefits**
- **Informed decisions** - Developer knows exactly what will be built
- **Reduced rework** - Solution validated before implementation

## 🚀 **Best Practices**

### **For AI Assistants**
- **Be thorough** in context gathering - read all relevant documentation
- **Be specific** in proposals - concrete technical solutions, not vague concepts
- **Be honest** about complexity and risks - don't oversimplify challenging work
- **Be explicit** about seeking approval - never assume permission to proceed

### **For Developers**
- **Review proposals carefully** - This is your chance to guide the approach
- **Ask clarifying questions** - Better to discuss upfront than rework later
- **Consider alternatives** - AI proposals are starting points, not final answers
- **Give clear approval** - Explicit "proceed" signals keep workflow moving

### **For Teams**
- **Use for complex tasks** - Simple tasks may not need full proposal workflow
- **Share proposals** - Team members can review and provide input
- **Document decisions** - Capture why certain approaches were chosen
- **Iterate on process** - Improve proposal quality based on outcomes
